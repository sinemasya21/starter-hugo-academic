I am a Ph.D. student of Sociology at [the Ohio State University](https://sociology.osu.edu/). My research interests include reproductive health, gender and sexuality, and feminist resistance with a focus on the MENA.

I have my BSc in Economics and Business Economics [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/school-business-and-economics), with a specialization in Emerging Markets. In 2020, I graduated with an MA in [Gender and Women's Studies in METU](https://gws.metu.edu.tr/en), working on Medical Sociology & Reproductive Health. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the Ohio State University.
